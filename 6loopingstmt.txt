Practice 6: Implementation of Looping Statements 

Aim: To implement basic looping structures like for and while loops. 

Procedure: 

    Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5. 
    Use a while loop to print numbers from 6 to 10. 

Simple Program: 

# For loop example 
for (i in 1:5) { 
print(i) 
} 
# While loop example 
i <- 6 
while (i <= 10) { 
print(i) 
i <- i + 1 
} 

Input: None 

Output: 

[1] 1 
[1] 2 
[1] 3 
[1] 4 
[1] 5 
[1] 6 
[1] 7 
[1] 8 
[1] 9 
[1] 10
