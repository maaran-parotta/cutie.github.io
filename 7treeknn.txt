Practice 7: Implementation of Decision Tree and KNN in R

Aim: To implement decision trees and KNN algorithms for classification tasks. 

Procedure: 

    Install and load the necessary package rpart for decision tree and class for 
KNN. 
    Use sample data for training. 

Simple Program for Decision Tree: 
 
# Load necessary libraries 
install.packages("rpart") 
library(rpart) 

# Sample data 
data(iris) 

# Create a decision tree 
model <- rpart(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, data = iris) 

# Print the model 
print(model) 

Input: iris dataset (comes preloaded in R) 

Output: Decision tree model summary.
